### Danbooru Touhou Bot

A bot that finds posts on danbooru, then retweets them from the artist.

Installing/Running
```
npm install

npm run start
```

To use it, create a config director and a default.json file following the format of the sample config file.

This will all be made much easier later. 

This is currently a proof of concept whipped up over a plane ride. More to come.
